### What I learned

HTML/CSS: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundation of web development. You should have a strong understanding of HTML to structure the content of the e-commerce site and CSS to style and position elements on the page.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a crucial programming language for frontend development. You'll need to learn JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your e-commerce site. This includes handling user interactions, validating input, making asynchronous requests, and updating the page content dynamically.

Frontend Frameworks: Familiarize yourself with popular frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. These frameworks provide efficient ways to build complex user interfaces, handle state management, and modularize your codebase. React, in particular, is widely used in e-commerce development.

Responsive Design: Learn how to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This involves using CSS media queries, flexible grid systems, and responsive images to ensure your e-commerce site looks and functions well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

UI/UX Design Principles: Understanding UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design principles is crucial to create an appealing and intuitive e-commerce site. Learn about visual design, typography, color theory, and usability principles to create an engaging user experience.
